Hi, I'm Nick! I'm interested primarily in the convergence between modern DevOps practices, defensive cybersecurity, and infrastructure automation both on-premises and in the cloud. I want to work on democratizing defensive cybersecurity toolsets and approaches while using open-source tooling in order to enhance enterprise security. Open-source red-team tooling has increased the effectiveness of both legal and criminal actors, and while advanced detection tooling is available, it can be too expensive to purchase for many organizations. I'd like to help fix that.
